# Widget-Shop-Simulator
Wrote a program using linked lists that mimics a store receiving widgets at varying prices and having to sell them on a FIFO policy.
The program tracks the amount of widgets purchased, provided discount to customers, and prints the total Sales, price after discount, and price after markup.
